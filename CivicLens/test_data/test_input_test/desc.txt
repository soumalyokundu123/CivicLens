Waterlogging:

Heavy waterlogging has accumulated across the main road near the market area, with knee-deep water completely disrupting transport services. Buses and auto-rickshaws are unable to operate, while pedestrians are forced to wade through dirty water that has led to traffic chaos, delays in emergency services, and rising health concerns for local residents.


Severe waterlogging around the hospital road has brought public transport to a standstill, with buses diverted and auto-rickshaws refusing to enter the flooded stretch. Commuters are stranded for hours, while ambulances and emergency vehicles are facing serious delays, creating a dangerous situation for patients and residents alike.


Potholes:

Large potholes have formed along the highway intersection, forcing vehicles to swerve suddenly and creating multiple near-miss accidents. The uneven surface is not only damaging cars and two-wheelers but also causing long traffic jams during peak hours.


Deep potholes on the market road have worsened after the recent rains, making it almost impossible for buses and autos to operate smoothly. Pedestrians too are at risk, as muddy water hides the depth of the craters, resulting in frequent slips and falls.


The presence of several potholes near the school entrance has become a serious concern for parents and children. School buses struggle to navigate safely, while two-wheelers often lose balance, raising the chances of accidents in front of the campus.


Garbage:

Piles of uncollected garbage have been lying unattended near the residential colony for over a week, producing a foul odor and attracting stray animals. The area has become a breeding ground for flies and mosquitoes, creating serious health risks for the families living nearby.


Overflowing garbage bins in the market area have spilled waste onto the street, blocking pathways and discouraging customers from visiting local shops. The unsanitary conditions are spreading quickly, raising concerns about the possible outbreak of diseases.


The public toilets near the bus stop are in extremely dirty condition, with overflowing sewage and no cleaning staff assigned. Commuters are forced to avoid the facility, while the strong stench is spreading across the surrounding area, making it unbearable for passersby.


Streetlight:

The broken streetlights near the school entrance are causing major difficulties for children and parents in the early morning and evening hours, as the area becomes dim and prone to accidents.


Several broken streetlights along the railway crossing have plunged the entire stretch into darkness, creating unsafe conditions for both pedestrians and vehicles. The lack of visibility has already caused minor accidents and raised concerns of theft and other crimes in the area.


The dim streetlights near the park vicinity are failing to provide adequate illumination, leaving joggers and residents walking in semi-darkness. This has raised safety concerns, especially for women and elderly people who rely on the park during evening hours.


Exposed wires dangling from a fallen streetlight pole near the school entrance are posing a serious electrocution hazard. Parents are deeply concerned as children pass through this route daily, and immediate intervention is needed to avoid accidents.
